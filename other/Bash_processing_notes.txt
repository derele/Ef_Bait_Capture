## Tally program on Bash (2): Deduplication of sequence fragments [Tally
## processes both files record-by-record and pair up records at the same
## offset. This requires the option --pair-by-offset.]  Tallying
## implicitly paired files In this scenario two files are implicitly
## paired, such as is the case for unprocessed paired-end FASTQ
## files. Tally will process both files record-by-record and pair up
## records at the same offset. This requires the option
## --pair-by-offset.  tally -i out1.gz -j out2.gz -o out1.unique.gz -p
## out2.unique.gz --pair-by-offset
